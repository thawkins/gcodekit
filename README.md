## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from Crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the latest release
cargo install gcodekit

# Run the application
gcodekit
```

#### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thawkins/gcodekit.git
cd gcodekit

# Build and install release version
cargo install --path .

# Run the application
gcodekit
```

#### Option 3: Build Without Installing

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thawkins/gcodekit.git
cd gcodekit

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Run the application
./target/release/gcodekit
```

### Linux Desktop Integration

For Linux users, you can add gcodekit to your application menu:

#### 1. Create Desktop Entry File

Create `~/.local/share/applications/gcodekit.desktop` with the following contents:

```desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=gcodekit
GenericName=CNC & Laser Controller
Comment=Professional GRBL CNC and Laser Controller
Exec=/home/USERNAME/.cargo/bin/gcodekit
Icon=applications-engineering
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;Engineering;Electronics;
Keywords=cnc;grbl;laser;gcode;cam;machining;
StartupNotify=true
StartupWMClass=gcodekit
```

**Important**: Replace `USERNAME` with your actual Linux username, or use `$HOME` in the Exec path.

#### 2. Make Desktop File Executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/gcodekit.desktop
```

#### 3. Update Desktop Database

```bash
# Update the application menu
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

#### 4. Verify Installation

The application should now appear in your application menu under "Development" or "Engineering" categories. You can search for "gcodekit" in your application launcher.

#### Alternative: System-wide Installation

For system-wide access (requires sudo):

```bash
# Create the desktop file in system location
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/gcodekit.desktop
```

Use the same desktop file contents, but adjust the Exec path to where the binary is installed (typically `/usr/local/bin/gcodekit` or `~/.cargo/bin/gcodekit`).

#### Using a Custom Icon (Optional)

If you want to use a custom icon:

1. Place your icon file (PNG or SVG) in `~/.local/share/icons/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons
   cp /path/to/gcodekit-icon.png ~/.local/share/icons/gcodekit.png
   ```

2. Update the Icon line in the desktop file:
   ```desktop
   Icon=/home/USERNAME/.local/share/icons/gcodekit.png
   ```

3. Or use the icon name without path if it's in a standard location:
   ```desktop
   Icon=gcodekit
   ```

## 🔨 Building

### Development Build
```bash
cargo build
```

### Release Build (Optimized)
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Development Tools
```bash
cargo check          # Fast compilation checking
cargo test           # Run all 341 tests

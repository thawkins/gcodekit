## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-10-18

### Added

**Phase 12 & 13: Real-Time Machine Status Monitoring & Device Console Integration**

#### Real-Time Machine Status Display (Phase 12)
- **Status Update Integration**: Enhanced app state with real-time machine status (`realtime_status: MachineStatus` field)
- **Status Display Components**:
  - Bottom status bar now shows live machine state with color coding:
    - Green (Idle), Blue (Run/Jog), Yellow (Hold/Door), Red (Alarm), Gray (Unknown/Sleep/Check)
  - Machine position (MPos) and work position (WPos) displayed with 2 decimal precision
  - Real-time feed rate (mm/min) and spindle speed (RPM) monitoring
  - Connection status with visual indicator (‚óè symbol)
  - Active port display with üìç icon

#### Device Console Integration (Phase 13)
- **Enhanced Device Console Tab** with:
  - Severity-based filtering (Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
  - Independent toggle checkboxes for each severity level
  - Real-time message filtering without losing history
  - Color-coded messages by type and severity:
    - ‚ùå Red for Errors
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow for Warnings
    - üîç Gray for Debug
    - ‚û°Ô∏è Blue for Commands
    - ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Green for Responses
    - üìù White for Trace
  - Message count display
  - Copy All and Clear controls

#### Automatic Message Filtering (Phase 13.1)
- **Status Query Hiding**: "?" commands automatically excluded from console

- **Intelligent Severity Assignment**: Device responses automatically categorized
- **Trace Output Support**: Application-level warnings and state changes logged

### Changed
- **Status Bar Layout**: Completely redesigned for professional appearance
  - More compact, information-dense display
  - Better visual hierarchy with separators
  - Emoji icons for visual indicators
- **App State Structure** (`app/state.rs`):
  - Added `realtime_status` field for live machine status

### Technical Improvements
- **Status Monitor Module**:
  - Real-time status polling (250ms interval)
  - Status history tracking with 300-sample buffer
  - Device logger integration for command/response tracking
  - Connection state monitoring

- **Error Recovery Integration Ready**:
  - Status monitor foundation for automatic error detection
  - Framework for corrective actions

### Testing
- **223 total tests passing** ‚úÖ
- Status monitoring tests for state tracking and history
- Device console message filtering tests
- All status monitor tests passing

### Performance
- Status queries: 4/second (250ms interval)
- Status history: 300 samples max (~75 seconds of data)
- Console messages: 5000 max (circular buffer)
- No performance degradation at 60 FPS rendering

### Documentation
- `PHASE_12_13_PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation plan
- `PHASE_12_13_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete technical documentation
- In-code documentation for all new functions

### Removed
- (No breaking changes)



### Removed
- **Rotary Axis Support (A, B, C, D)**: Removed all support for rotary axes to simplify codebase. GRBL-based machines typically use 3-axis (XYZ) operation. Can be reintroduced if needed.
  - Removed optional fields from `MachinePosition` struct
  - Removed builder methods (`with_a()`, `with_b()`, `with_c()`, `with_d()`)
  - Removed rotary axis jog controls from jog widget
  - Removed rotary axis position tracking
  - Updated communication module status parsing
  - Impact: ~180 lines removed, improved performance

- **Code Folding Feature**: Removed code folding from G-code editor as GRBL doesn't support code blocks
  - Removed `FoldRegion` and `FoldManager` structs
  - Removed fold-related UI controls and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+], Ctrl+Shift+], Ctrl+Shift+[)
  - Removed fold detection logic and tests
  - Impact: ~300 lines removed, fixed gutter alignment issues

### Changed
- **Jog Widget Redesign**: Complete redesign to match professional control panel layout
  - Implemented 4-row grid structure for better organization
  - Reduced button size from 100√ó100 to 60√ó60 pixels
  - Added theme-aware colors (respects light/dark mode)
  - Header now shows "Step Size | Jog Feed" with current position display
  - G-code workspace macros (G54-G57) integrated into main grid
  - Placeholder row added for future expansion

- **Theme Support**: All jog widget buttons now theme-aware
  - Buttons adapt to system light/dark theme
  - Emergency stop remains red with white text for safety
  - Improved readability in all conditions

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - README.md: Updated feature list for 3-axis focus
  - SPEC.md: Changed multi-axis to 3-axis optimization
  - GUTTER_ALIGNMENT_FIX.md: Simplified after folding removal
  - Updated test counts (143 vs previous 341)

- **Gutter Alignment**: Improved gutter rendering
  - Now uses theme-aware colors from `ui.visuals()`
  - Maintains perfect pixel-perfect alignment

### Fixed
- Gutter line numbers alignment issues in editor
- Theme-related button readability in dark mode
- Simplified position tracking logic

### Technical
- Removed ~480 lines of code
- Removed ~200 tests related to rotary axes and folding
- All 143 remaining tests passing ‚úÖ
- Clean build with no warnings
- Code complexity reduced significantly

## Migration Guide

### For Rotary Axis Users

If you need rotary axis support in the future:
1. The removal is clean and documented
2. Easy to reintroduce if requirements change
3. See `docs/ROTARY_AXIS_REMOVAL.md` for details

### For Code Folding Users

Code folding was removed due to complexity and GRBL limitations:
- See `docs/FOLDING_FEATURE_REMOVAL.md` for details
- Reason: GRBL doesn't support code blocks
- Can be reintroduced if needed
